It also includes communication protocols with a Custom Drupal Module (In the works).\r\n\r\n==================\r\n\r\n### What it provides\r\n\r\n* An Augmented reality view out-of-the-box\r\n* Customizable AR Overlays\r\n* Simple and efficient Data Storing for AR Objects using SQLite DB\r\n* Communication system with a Drupal module for simple creation of content on a site\r\n* Custom Map Pin annotation\r\n\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\nSeveral Libraries are required for PRAugmentedReality to work in your app:\r\n* AVFoundation\r\n* CoreGraphics\r\n* CoreLocation\r\n* CoreMotion\r\n* MapKit\r\n* MobileCoreServices\r\n* SystemConfiguration\r\n* libz\r\n* libsqlite\r\n\r\n3 Frameworks are included in the Library for your convenience:\r\n* [fmdb](https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb)\r\n* [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking)   --> See notes for manual changes\r\n* [DIOS](https://github.com/workhabitinc/drupal-ios-sdk)\t\t--> See notes for manual changes\r\n\r\nYou are free to remove them and use the most up to date versions or use tools like cocoapods. As a side note, work is currently done to add this library to cocoapods.\r\n\r\nThe `ARSettings.h` file is where all global constants are set. This is where you will set the URL of the site to get data from.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Notes:\r\n\r\n#### AFNetworking\r\nPlease note that AFNetworking only supports ARC. As PRAugmentedReality does not yet support ARC, you must manually flag AFNetworking files with \"-fobjc-arc\"\r\n\r\n(in `Build Phases->Compile Sources`)\r\n\r\n#### DIOS\r\n\r\nPlease note that in order to keep all the settings in one place, it is required to edit the `Settings.h` file in DIOS. \r\n(This only applies if you are downloading DIOS yourself instead of using the version given in this repo)\r\n\r\nReplace the difinition of \"kDiosBaseUrl\" in DIOS's settings.h with an import of PRAugmentedReality's ARSettings.h:\r\n\r\nReplace `#define kDiosBaseUrl @\"http://d7.workhabit.com\"` with `#import \"ARSettings.h\"`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Version Requirements\r\n\r\nPRAugmentedReality is compatible with iOS 5.0 or later.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nTo come\r\n","google":"UA-39098334-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
